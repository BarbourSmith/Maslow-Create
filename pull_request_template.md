Thanks for contributing to Maslow Create! You rock.

Pull requests for bug fixes, performance increases, and new atoms which cannot be made from a combination of existing atoms are very welcome. New atoms which are possible through a combination of existing atoms are better created as new Maslow Create projects which can be imported through GitHub.
